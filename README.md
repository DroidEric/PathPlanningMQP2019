# Autonomous Path Planning Under Cyberattacks

The Autonomous Path Planning Under Cyberattacks Major Qualifying Project (MQP), as part of an undergraduate degree requirement at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This project runs code on a remote computer using Ubuntu Linux 16.04 with ROS Kinetic Installed. This remote computer communicates to a Turtlebot3 Burger robot via Wi-Fi connection. 

### Installing

First, in order to run the simulation, ROS Kinetic must be installed. Installation instructions for ROS Kinetic can be found on the [ROS Documentation Website](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation)

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
